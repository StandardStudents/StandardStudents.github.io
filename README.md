What is Standard Students?
Standard Students is a podcast hosted by two extremely "witty" hosts. The focus of the podcast is mainly high school, but we will talk about other stuff too.

Why should I listen?
Because you may be sympathetic to us; afterall, we are in high school.

Who are you?
I'm an eagle.
